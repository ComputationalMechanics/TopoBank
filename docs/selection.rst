Selecting topographies, surfaces, and tags
==========================================

How the total selection should be affected, when
a single item is selected:

Selecting a single topography
    Make sure, only the full surface is selected and not the
    individual topographies if all were selected.

Unselecting a single topography:
    Make sure the surface is not selected any more, if so.
    Make sure the topography is also not selected any more.

Selecting a single surface:
    Make sure no individual topographies from this surface
    are selected any more.

Unselecting a single surface:
    Make sure no individual topographies from this surface
    are selected any more.

Selecting a single tag:
    Only select tag. Does not affect individual surface or topography selection.

Unselecting a single tag:
    Only unselect tag. Does not affect individual surface or topography selection.
